## 🚀 Project Overview

**FastAPI-LLM** is an advanced, Dockerized Python project that integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with a **FastAPI backend**. It demonstrates how to leverage AI to perform intelligent automation tasks and exposes APIs that can be consumed by other applications.

This project is production-ready in structure, containerized with Docker, and designed for deployment on **cloud platforms like AWS**.

---

## 🧱 Features

* **FastAPI Backend:** Lightweight, high-performance web API framework.
* **LLM Integration:** Uses AI models to perform automation and intelligent processing.
* **Dockerized:** Easily run the app locally or in cloud environments without dependency conflicts.
* **Cloud-Ready:** Fully compatible with AWS ECS / EC2 deployment.
* **Modular Architecture:** Clean folder structure for scalability and maintainability.
* **Health Endpoint:** Check service status with a simple `/health` route.

## 💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Docker installed locally
* Optional: OpenAI API key for LLM integration

### Run Locally with Docker

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t fastapi-llm:latest .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 fastapi-llm:latest

# Visit API health check
http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Using the LLM API

* Ensure your **OpenAI API key** or other LLM credentials are configured in `.env`
* Call the AI-powered endpoints via **POST requests** with your input payload.

## 📦 Deployment

* Dockerized project can be deployed on **AWS Free Tier** using ECS or EC2.
* Cloud storage (like **S3**) can be used for storing outputs or logs.
* CI/CD (GitHub Actions) can automate building and pushing Docker images to **GHCR**.

---

## 🛠️ Future Improvements

* Add **authentication & authorization** to API routes
* Implement **automatic versioned Docker builds** via CI/CD
* Extend AI services with **multiple LLM models** and pipelines
* Integrate **logging & monitoring** for production readiness
